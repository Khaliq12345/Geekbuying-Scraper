# Geekbuying-Scraper

This project is a web scraping script built using the Python Scrapy framework. 
The script is designed to scrape product information such as name, price, description, and image from the Geekbuying website. 
The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file or any other format that you have chosen. 
The spider created with scrapy is able to navigate through the website, and follow the links to other pages to scrape multiple products. 
This script can be useful for anyone looking to collect and analyze data from the Geekbuying website.

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own web scraping projects, and to make any changes as you see fit.
